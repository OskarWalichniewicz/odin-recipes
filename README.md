# odin-recipes

Page preview [here](https://oskarwalichniewicz.github.io/odin-recipes/).

This is implementation of exercise [Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes) by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). The goal of this exercise is to practice HTML elements taught so far.

I'll also put emphasis on gaining experience using Git, eg.:

- Creating and cloning repository,
- committing and pushing,
- writing good commit messages,
- trying [atomic commits](https://www.freshconsulting.com/insights/blog/atomic-commits/) in practice.
